But motivation, it is a rare skill that separates normal from awesomeness. Since this is program for self-development, we are going to start with reflecting what is actually motivation and why is it needed. Since without motivation, you will fail this program for sure.",
          "2": "First we will have to go all the way back to year 2012. At this time I was still an exchange student in Beijing as part of my studies. I met my current in wife in May when our studies were to end in June. When we started seeing each other, we had little bit of language barrier problem. I actually only spoke Finnish, English and really basic level of Chinese when she could only could speak Chinese.",
          "3": "Since our studies were going to end June and our Visas to expire end of July, most of the exchange students were planning on going to travel around of China. This was actually first time when I had to think in the long term what I actually want. Short term joy and experiences with friends by traveling or great uncertainty with pursuing long term happiness.",
          "4": "This was actually hard decision. Uncertainty is never comfortable feeling. I chose uncertainty and stayed in our dorm while others went to travel. I had to find a way to expand my Visa if I wanted this to work. With patience I was able to find out a solution that worked out the best: apply to a school to study only Chinese for half a year for three hours a day.",
          "5": "As half a year went by, we decided together come to Finland and get marry. At this time I had been studying my bachelor of applied sciences for three years and started to think how can I provide for our future family?",
          "6": "I realized, shit, no employee would ever pay for me with my current knowledge. I haven't actually learned anything in school that would be valuable for any employee. This was the starting point for my career. Realizing how little you actually know and what are your possibilities with your current knowledge.",
          "7": "I knew this had to change or otherwise when we get kids, their life wouldn't be as good as would hope for them. Again, I faced a situation where I had to choose: go the easy way and pass all the school courses or actually accomplish what you want from the life. At this time I still had 1,5 years of school ahead of me.",
          "8": "This might be something that you didn't expect from me but I HATED programming in school. I hated it, it was awful. Lot of things that didn't make any sense. I also failed my first programming course in school...",
          "9": "Funny thing is that I didn't have a clue what I should or could do after graduating. One thing was clear, I want to provide for my family, now and in the future. My goal was clear: after graduating get a paying job. Only this one thing matters and nothing else don't.",
          "10": "I thought a lot of different things but it should be something that I can develop myself at home. Even though I hated programming at school, I thought it didn't hurt if I read something about it just to find out could it be the thing for me. I found 'Beginning C++ Though Game Programming' -book that blew me away with content that was interesting for me and it made sense. Programming made sense, I loved it. After reading and studying this book, it was end of February 2013, but one thing was clear. I will be a programmer when I graduate.",
          "11": "Then I had to self-reflect and think I what I can do to get there. I still would have ~1,5 years of school left that hadn't taught me anything (or maybe just to be lazy). But the good thing was that I knew what I want. I proposed my teachers that I would only attend required courses that I had left and otherwise would study at home programming for 30 hours per week. I am glad that I had a great teacher that approved my plan. I also heard comments that disdained me for not attending school classes and questioning me that was I sure what I was doing. But my goal was clear and I had clear vision how to get there.",
          "12": "For the next year I studied at home 30 hours per week programming. I read a lot of books, coded what I hard learned. During this time I was also looking for thesis subject so I could graduate from school. I had to turn down at least five different subjects since I knew that they wouldn't help me achieve what I wanted, a programming job. After 6 months of searching I finally finded a thesis subject that would help be get where I wanted.",
          "13": "For next four months or so, I was studying and working for the thesis 40 - 50+ hours per week. I can tell you that it wasn't easy, there wasn't pay or anything but I was sure if I work hard, self-develop myself and actually suffer for the next four months I can get my first job as programmer. This was probably hardest or the most demanding time of my life because I wanted to SHINE, SUCCEED with my thesis to being able to land my first job.",
          "14": "But it paid off, I was able to land my first job before graduating. I have self-reflected reasons for this. It is most likely because I could show that I have studied last year 1000+ hours programming (C++, C#, frameworks, concepts etc...) and I actually understood basics concepts of object-oriented programming.",
          "15": "This was a long story but with motivation long stories are needed because motivation is something that must last test of time. What I found out is that without actual motivation you can do something, maybe one week, few weeks, maximum of one month but then you can't force youselve anymore.",
          "16": "What you need to actually develop yourself and shine is a MOTIVATION, what drives you forward. This is also something that should change with your life situations and not stay stabile. Motivation is what actually separates just average from AWESOME.",
          "17": "I can tell you that my own motivations have changed multiple time over my career and this has been my strenght. To find something that motivates me go excell myself and pursue greatness.",
          "18": "Now is time for yourself to reflect, what is your motivation? Why do you want to shine? How can you actually keep on shining? It is something that you need if you want to be AWESOME.",
          "19": "You are going to need motivation to achieve anything actually meaningful in life. Without motivation you are doomed for mediocre."
